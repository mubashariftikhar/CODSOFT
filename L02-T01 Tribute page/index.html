          Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi ( born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani former
          cricketer and politician who served as the 22nd prime minister of
          Pakistan from August 2018 until April 2022. He is the founder and
          chairman of the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). Born
          to a Niazi Pashtun family in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble
          College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 1971
          Test series against England. Khan played until 1992, served as the
          team's captain intermittently between 1982 and 1992, and won the 1992
          Cricket World Cup, Pakistan's only victory in the competition.
          Considered one of cricket's greatest all-rounders, Khan was later
          inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. Founding the Pakistan
          Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in 1996, Khan won a seat in the National
          Assembly in the 2002 general election, serving as an opposition member
          from Mianwali until 2007. PTI boycotted the 2008 general election and
          became the second-largest party by popular vote in the 2013 general
          election. In the 2018 general election, running on a populist
          platform, PTI became the largest party in the National Assembly, and
          formed a coalition government with independents with Khan as prime
          minister
